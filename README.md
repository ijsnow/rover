### Inspired by Resource Override

I used [Resource Override](https://github.com/kylepaulsen/ResourceOverride) very heavily in my day to day
at work in Chrome and recently switched to using Firefox. Resource Override only works in chrome, so I decided to
make this for Firefox. I'll eventually make this available on Chrome as well as I test the [extension I work on at work](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sourcegraph-for-github/dgjhfomjieaadpoljlnidmbgkdffpack?hl=en) on both Chrome and Firefox.

### Why no UI?

I'm kinda lazy.

In addition to this, it only made sense for me to create a workflow that allows me to use all the features of the tool without moving my hands from keyboard to mouse and back.

I subscribe to a command line heavy workflow. My [environment](https://github.com/ijsnow/env) vim, tmux and other tools that allow me to not have to switch back and forth from mouse. I even use [vim-vixen](https://github.com/ueokande/vim-vixen) to vim-ify Firefox.
